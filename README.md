# Loan Data Exploration



## Dataset
___
The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, loan term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc. The dataset can be found <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;ust%3D1581581520570000&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1657061226002452&usg=AOvVaw2YoV9hdHyBRNY_mMgzVrVs"> here</a>.

## Summary of Findings
___
In the investigation, I found that the borrowerâ€™s APR affected by a number of factors.</p>


According to <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/factors-impact-personal-loan-interest-rates">Fox Business</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-factors-lenders-consider-when-determining-apr/#:~:text=The%20better%20your%20score%2C%20the,considered%20more%20of%20a%20risk.">CNBC</a>, the seven (7) major factors that affect a loan's outcome status and a borrower's APR will be discussed. The factors are:


**Credit score:** It's a number assigned to borrowers to help lenders assess risk. A debtor's score will be based on his/her outstanding balances, repayment record, credit mix, and account/loan length.
        
**Interest rate type (fixed or variable):** Fixed-rate loans charge the same APR throughout the lifetime (term) of the loan. Variable-rate loans fluctuate, meaning you could potentially save money but also be charged more if rates go up.

**Debt-to-income ratio:** This is the amount of debt compared to gross income.

**Employment history and income:** Lenders want to know how you plan to pay back the loan, and they typically look at your employment history. Many lenders review the past 24 months of employment history, while some may go back further. They are looking for a solid track record of employment or a steady source of income.

**Loan term and amount:** This is the duration of the loan. The length of the loan will also impact your interest rate. Longer-term loans usually have higher rates than shorter loans.

**Collateral:** Giving out loans is a risky venture. Therefore, a lender wants an assurance that a borrower is able to pay back, and should he/she fail, what can the Lender fall back on that may guarantee the recovery of the loan first, and then interest for taking on risk.</l1>

**Type of credit product:** The lender will be interested in what you plan to use the funds for.

**Location:** Mortgages, in particular, are influenced by state and municipal governments. Every state may have unique taxes, property laws, grants and/or regulations that can impact what your mortgage will cost you.

**Payment history:** More on-time payments make you a competitive applicant for lower rates.



## Key Insights for Presentation
___
My key interest was on features that affected the borrower APR, which are original loan amount, Prosper rating, e.t.c. I began by visualizing the distribution of Credit Grade and Prosper Rating. Then, I analyzed the relationship between APR vs. loan amount, and other features. I did investigate the effect of rating on ralationship between APR and loan amount and other features.</p>
